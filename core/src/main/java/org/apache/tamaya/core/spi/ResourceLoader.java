 * Interface to be implemented by containers that decouples loading of classpath resources from the effective

 * locations. A an example the expression {@code cfg/global/*.xml} defines a
 * location for reading global configuration in the classpath. A resources
 * interprets this expression and evaluates the concrete resources to be read,
 * e.g. {@code cfg/global/default.xml, cfg/global/myApp.xml}.
