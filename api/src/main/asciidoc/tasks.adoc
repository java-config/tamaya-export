== Introduction

== What is Tamaya

{name} is the Apache standard for flexible and powerful configuration. Objective is to provide flavors for
Java SE, ME as well as to ship with powerful features for Java EE and Cloud Solutions. All functions provided
is build on top of a small but very powerful, flexible and extendible API. This API is implemented by a core implementation,
which then can be extended or adapted for use in different runtime scenarios, such as SE, ME, EE, Spring, OSGI
and more. Similarly additional modules may be provided that help also existing solution to be plugged into
{name}, so you can start right away using {name} without having to rebuild/change your existing application.

== Main Features of {name}

The main features of {name} currently are

* *A simple key/value store*, named +PropertyProvider+ (simply called "provider").
* Simple *built-in meta-data model*, that allows to easily attach metadata to a provider or single property keys.
* Support for *different configuration formats*.
* Support for *different configuration locations*, including remote locations.
* Powerful and flexible *options to combine providers to new composite providers* using different combination policies.
* The *Configuration model* adds additional features:
** *Type Adapters* allow to convert configuration into any required target type.
** *Built-in support* for all basic Java types.
* *Contextual, hierarchical and multi-layered environment model*. The model is rather simple, but nevertheless
  powerful enough to map complex layered runtime environments such as Java EE or multi-tenant SaaS solutions.
* *Configurable System Properties* allow to tweak system properties to behave contextually.
* *Templates* provide a type safe configuration mechanism where an annotated interface is implemented by the
  configuration system, providing data from an underlying configuration.
* *Configuration Injection* allows configured values to be directly injected into the bean's configured.
* *Loading Policies* allow to control how configuration changes are reflected on the configured beans.
* *Configuration Operators and Queries* can be used to easily implement advanced features such as *Views,
  Security Constraints and Filters*.
* Provider and configuration changes can be observed by registering *PropertyChangeListeners*.
* Configurations are *versioned*, so remote pull scenarios can be implemented very efficiently.
* The system supports *multiple configurations* identified by name.
* The configuration system provides a powerful management console for reading and updating of configuration.
* The system also supports distributed configuration scenarios by leveraging existing solutions, such as Memcached,
  Hazelcast or Zookeper.
* The system is built on "Java 8 features*.
* A *Java 7 Backport* is provided.

=== Purpose of this Document

The document should help to organize people and ideas around the Apache Tamaya Library. It list possible features,
ideas and tasks that need to be done. Everybody can have a look at and see, where hos contribution and capabilities
would fit best.

== Basics

=== Styles, Logo

The project requires

* a good Apache styled logo and
* CSS styles as needed,
* an initial web page,
* a twitter account
* ...

=== Infrastructure

We should setup all needed infrastructure
* code repos
* project modules (including module sites)
* coding and documentation guidelines
* automatic builds (CI), included automatic coverage and sonar quality checks.
* a docker image or appliance, with everything setup, so contributors can easily
  start contributing...
* ...

== Main Features

=== Metadata Model

Currently +MetaInfo+ models metadata as a separate constuct. It has been shown that this leads to more complex
handling when creating composites and makes the API overall more complex. The idea is to model metadata as simple
key/value pairs, that are part of the provider/configuration data as well, but handled separately. Metadata hereby
is identified by a starting '_' character in its key. For example refer to the following configuration properties:

[source,listing]
.Basic Properties
----------------------------------------------------------------
a.b.Foo=foo
a.b.Bar=bar
a.AnyOther=whatelse
Something=none
----------------------------------------------------------------

Now we can model meta-data as follows:

[source,listing]
.Metadata Properties
----------------------------------------------------------------
[a.b].info=An area info
[a.b.Foo].auth=role1,role2
[a.b.Foo].encrypt=PGP
[a.b.Foo].sensitive=true
[].info=This is a test configuration example.
----------------------------------------------------------------

The above would model the following:

* The area +a.b+ has the meta property +info+.
* The entry +a.b.Foo+ has three meta properties +auth,encrypt+ and +sensitive+. These could be interpreted by a security
  view and used to encrypt the values returned by the configuration instance, if not the current user has one of the
  specified roles.
* The last meta data defines an attribute +info+ for the whole provider/configuration (the root area).

Given that the overall entries would be as follows:

[source,listing]
.Full Properties with Meta Properties
----------------------------------------------------------------
[a.b].info=An area info
a.b.Foo=foo
[a.b.Foo].auth=role1,role2
[a.b.Foo].encrypt=PGP
[a.b.Foo].sensitive=true
a.b.Bar=bar
[].info=This is a test configuration example.
a.AnyOther=whatelse
Something=none
----------------------------------------------------------------

The current +MetaInfo+ class could be adapted, so it is reading data from the underlying configuration/provider,
instead of its own datastructure. This would make a later mapping of configuration and its metadata into DB table, JSON
etc, much more easier.
The providers on the other side may suppress any metadata from ordinary output, such
as +toString()+, Similarly accessing metadata using the official config API (+get, getOrDefault, getAreas+ etc)
should be disabled. The +MetaInfoBuilder+ must probably as well adapted or redesigned.

=== Collection Support

Add a key/value based model for mapping collections such as sets, maps, list. Implement according adapters.
In combination with the metadata model above this could be something like:

[source,listing]
.Collection Support
----------------------------------------------------------------
mySet=[a,b,c,d,e\,e,f]
[mySet].type=set
#optional define the implementation class
[mySet].class=java.util.TreeSet

myList=[a,b,c,d,e\,e,f]
[myList].type=list
#optional define the implementation class
[myList].class=java.util.ArrayList

myMap=[a:aa,b:bb,c:cc,d:dd,e:e\,e,f:ff]
[myMap].type=map
#optional define the implementation class
[myMap].class=java.util.TreeMap

#Finally we could also add support for non String based types
myTypedSet=[1,2,3,4.5,6,7.10.123]
[myTypedSet].contentClass=java.lang.Double
myTypedList=[CHF 10.20, EUR 12.20, BTC 0.002]
[myTypedList].contentType=org.javamoney.moneta.FastMoney
myTypedMap=[CHF:CHF 10.20, EUR:EUR 12.20, BTC:BTC 0.002]
[myTypedMap].contentTypes=javax.money.CurrencyUnit,javax.money.MonetaryAmount
----------------------------------------------------------------


=== Management Service

A JMX/Restful API should be designed and built that exposes configuration information. Access should be secured, e.g.
using OAuth or other security mechasnisms.

=== Management Client

A nice web-based client to manage configuration data would be nice as well. This also includes a UI for creating new
configurations.

=== Mapping Configuration to a Database

A flexible mechanism should be implemented that allows the use of databases (SQL/JPA as well as non-SQL) for
storing/retreiving/managing configuration:

* JPA, Hibernate
* MongoDB
* ...

=== Integration with OSGI

Examples are to be created and tested, where OSGI is used as the basic runtime platform, e.g. Apache Felix, but as well
others.

=== Integration with Jigsaw

Once Jigsaw is mature and in a usable (still early) stage, examples are to be created and tested, where OSGI is used as
the basic runtime platform, e.g. Apache Felix, but as well others.

== Distributed/Remote Configuration Support

=== Configuration Server

A configuration server should be implemented that provides access to configurations and triggers updates to registered
clients (push). Similarly a poull model should be supported, where clients can asl for the current version id of a certain
configuration and reload it if necessary.

=== Configuration Distribution Policies

Different configuration distribution policies should be defined any implemented, e.g. distributed cache, restful services,
web services, EJB/RMI calls, asynchronous queues, publish/subsribe models, ...

=== Dynamic Service Lookup

Configuration Servers and Clients should bea ble to locate each other in different ways:

* with fixed configured IPs, or IP ranges
* using a dynamic service location protocol like
** SLP
** Distributed Maps/Datagrids
** Apache Zookeeper

=== Configuration Client

A subset of the API would be created that exposes only a well defined subset, of exactly one configuration targeted
to a certain instance, VM or whatever. The client should be connectable to a server in different ways (see configuration
distributiont policies).

=== Preferences Support

Write a +PreferencesFactory+ for +java.util.preferences+.

== Third Party Integration

=== Integration with Deltaspike Config

Integration with Deltaspike Config should be implemented and discussed with Deltaspike guys.

=== Integration with Spring

A {name} module should be created that allows Spring to be used either as client or configuration provider.

=== Integration with Jetty

A {name} module should be created that allows a Jetty instance to be deployed and started that is (completely)
configured based on configuration server.

=== Integration with Tomcat

A {name} module should be created that allows a Tomcat instance to be deployed and started that is (completely)
configured based on configuration server.

=== Configuration of Java EE

In the Java EE area there would be several options:

=== Configuration of Application Servers (administrative resources)

It should be possible to start a application server instance remotely and configure all administrative resources and the
deployments based on the configuration service, server to be considered maybe

* Wildfly
* IBM
* Weblogic
* Glassfish
* Apache Geronimo

==== Configuration of CDI

Implement a CDI extension that controls CDI based on configuration:
* Add beans
* Remove (veto) beans
* Add/remove interceptors
* Add/remove decorators
* Activate alternatives
* ...

==== Configuration of Bean Validation

* Add configurable validators.
* Configure bean validation based on configuration
* ...

=== JNDI Support

Write a +JCA+ adapter to provide configuration data through JNDI.

==== Configure JSF

Use the JSF +XML Document+ event to completely configure JSF.

==== Configure Web Services

Provide a WebServiceProviderFactory that may be configured.

==== Configure JPA

Provide an implementation that allows configuration of persistence units. Talk with JPA EG people to see if we can
get an SPI to hook in a stadardized way.

==== Configure EJBs

Provide an implementation that allows configuration of EJBs and MDBs:

* Register beans
* Unregister/disable beans
* Intercept beans
* Support Configuration Injection (in the worst case using a standard Interceptor, provide supporting artifacts to
  help developers to achive this easily).
* Talk with EE8 Umbrella EG (Bill Shanon, Linda DeMichels) on a feasible SPI for EE8, if possible join the EG.

==== Configure ...

Just think of any Java EE aspects that might be worth to be configured. If it can be done, e.g. by managing CDI managed
resources, it might be easy. For others it is a good idea to discuss things with our matter of experts...

== Special Goodies

=== Maintenance Mode Servlet Filter

Provide a servlet filter that is capable of switching to maintenance mode, based on configuration. Similarly also a forwarding
servlet could be useful, wehere only request based on configuration are forwarded, other might be rejected or dropped
as configured.

=== Dynamic Camel Routes

Provides dynamic (configurable) Camel routes, e.g. usable within ServiceMix or standalone.

=== Dynamic CXF

Provides dynamic (configurable) CXF adapters, e.g. usable within ServiceMix or standalone.

=== Configurable Apache MQ

Provides an implementation for configuring Apache MQ.

=== Dynamic Logging

Provide a dynamic solution, where logging systems are configured (handlers, log levels etc), e.g. for

* slf4j
* log4j
* JUL

Also interesting is a feature that allows to dynamically log on a more finer level depending on a concrete
subject/user, session id or server or ...

=== Dynamic ...

Interested to see what other ideas are around. Let us know!
